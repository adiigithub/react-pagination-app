# React Pagination Application

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **React-based application** created as part of a **machine coding / practice task**. The main focus of this app is to demonstrate how to **implement pagination** while fetching and displaying data efficiently.

The project showcases clean component structure, proper use of React hooks, and handling of real-world UI scenarios.
